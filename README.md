# Marketing Analysis using SQL

## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform various marketing analyses for an imaginary company "Maven Fuzzy Factory" as their eCommerce Data Analyst. 

This project follows the "Advanced SQL + MySQL for Analytics & Business Intelligence" course on Udemy and is a great demonstration of the very similar type of analyses that I perform as a data analyst at my current company. 

Unfortunately, I'm not able to post that work on Github due to proprietary data, so I decided to follow a Udemy project that reflects the analyses that I do on a daily basis.
